# Changelog

## [Unreleased] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- **Gravity Reset:** Fixed a bug where game speed (gravity) would not reset after Game Over or Restart, causing new games to start at high speed.

    - Fixed "Quit to Home" triggering Game Over screen.
    - Added "Restart" button to Game Over screen.
    - Improved Game Over menu styling (Overlay, Gradient Button).
    - Fixed Game Over overlay lingering when starting a new game from Home.
- **Pause Button:** Fixed Pause button text showing "Resume" incorrectly after quitting to home and starting a new game.
- **PWA Updates:** Enabled automatic Service Worker updates on page reload to ensure the latest UI is served (Fixes "Refresh vs Hard Refresh" issue).

### Added
- **Game Navigation Tests:** Added `GameNavigation.test.ts` to verify flow between Home, Game, Pause, and Game Over states.
- **Button State Tests:** Added `GameButtonState.test.ts` to verify UI button text states.

### Changed
- **Refactoring:** Moved Game Over UI rendering from Canvas (`Renderer.ts`) to DOM (`GameUI.ts`) for better interactivity and styling.
